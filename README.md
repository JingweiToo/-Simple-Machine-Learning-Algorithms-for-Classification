# Simple Machine Learning Toolbox for Classification

* This toolbox contains 7 widely used machine learning algorithms   

* The < A_Main.m file > shows examples of how to use these machine learning methods with the benchmark data set.  

## Output
* The displayed results include: 
  + Accuracy for each fold in k-fold cross-validation 
  + Average accuracy over k-folds 
  + Confusion matrix.
