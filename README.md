# -Simple-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-for-Classification
This toolbox contains six widely used machine learning algorithms (1) K-nearest Neighbor (KNN) (2) Support Vector Machine (SVM) (3) Decision Tree (DT) (4) Discriminate Analysis Classifier (DA) (5) Naive Bayes (NB) (6) Random Forest (RF)  

The "Main" script shows examples of how to use these machine learning programs with the benchmark data set.  The displayed results include: (1) Accuracy for each fold in k-fold cross-validation (2) Average accuracy over k-folds (3) Confusion matrix.
